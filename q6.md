### <p align="center"> INTRODUCTION </p>

This program converts a standard unsorted array of integers into two types of heap structures: a Min Heap and a Max Heap. Heaps are specialized complete binary trees used in priority queues and sorting algorithms where the parent node must always satisfy a specific magnitude relationship with its children.

<p align="center"> DATA STRUCTURE USED </p>

The heap is represented using a Linear Array to simulate a Complete Binary Tree. This allows for efficient access to children and parents using mathematical indices:

Left Child Index: $2i + 1$

Right Child Index: $2i + 2$

Parent Index: $(i - 1) / 2$

### <p align="center"> FUNCTIONS USED </p>

swapElements(int *x, int *y)
A utility function that swaps the values of two integers. This is used repeatedly during the heapify process to move elements to their correct positions.

maxHeapProperty(int arr[], int size, int i)
A recursive function that maintains the Max Heap property. It compares a parent node with its children and, if the parent is smaller, swaps it with the largest child and continues the process downward.

minHeapProperty(int arr[], int size, int i)
A recursive function that maintains the Min Heap property. It ensures that the parent node is always smaller than its children by swapping the parent with the smallest child whenever a violation is detected.

buildMaxHeap(int arr[], int size) / buildMinHeap(...)
These functions transform an unsorted array into a heap. They start from the last non-leaf node and move upward to the root, calling the respective heap property function at each step to ensure the entire tree is valid.

### <p align="center"> WORKING ALGORITHM </p>

Input: The user provides the number of elements and the actual integer data.

Construction: To build the heap efficiently, the program starts from the middle of the array (the last non-leaf node) and works backward.

Heapification: For each node, the "sift-down" logic is applied. In a Max Heap, the larger value travels up; in a Min Heap, the smaller value travels up.

Output: The program displays the final array representation which corresponds to the level-order traversal of the resulting heap tree.

Input Elements: 12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7

Max Heap Result: 13 11 12 5 6 7
