## ## <p align="center"> PROJECT OVERVIEW </p>

This assignment covers a wide range of topics including Stacks, Linked Lists, Graphs, Heaps, and Sorting Algorithms. Each solution is split into a source file (`prog_<q>.c`) and a detailed documentation file (`doc_<q>.md`).

### Task List:
1.  **Balanced Parentheses:** Stack-based expression validation.
2.  **Infix to Postfix:** Conversion and evaluation of mathematical expressions.
3.  **Reverse Traversal:** Recursive traversal in a Singly Linked List.
4.  **Doubly Linked List:** Implementation of structure-based insertion and deletion.
5.  **Graph Traversal:** BFS and DFS implementations using an Adjacency Matrix.
6.  **Heaps:** Building Min and Max heaps from unsorted data.
7.  **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
8.  **Sorting Analysis:** Comparative study of Bubble, Selection, Insertion, and Merge Sort.
