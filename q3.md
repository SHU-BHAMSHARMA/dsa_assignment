### <p align="center"> INTRODUCTION </p>

This program demonstrates the implementation of a Singly Linked List and a specific algorithm to traverse and print its elements in reverse order. While standard traversal moves from head to tail, this implementation uses recursion to print from tail to head.

### <p align="center"> DATA STRUCTURE USED </p>

A Singly Linked List is used, where each element is a structure containing:

value: An integer to store the actual data.

next: A pointer to the subsequent node in the sequence.

### <p align="center"> FUNCTIONS USED </p>

append(struct Node **head_ref, int new_data)
Creates a new node and attaches it to the end of the linked list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head.

traverseBackward(struct Node *n)
This is the core recursive function. It calls itself for the next node until it reaches the end of the list, then prints the data as the recursion stack unwinds.

---

### <p align="center"> WORKING ALGORITHM </p>

The function receives the pointer to the head node.

Base Case: If the current node is NULL, the function returns.

Recursive Step: The function calls itself passing the next pointer of the current node. This moves the execution "pointer" to the end of the list.

Action: After the recursive call returns (backtracking), the data of the current node is printed. This ensures the last node visited is the first node printed.
